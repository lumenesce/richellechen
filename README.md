# Welcome to my personal website!

This is currently a work in progress and I plan to keep it updated throughout the uni break! My aims with this website are to practise and showcase my design and coding abilities, and it also serves as a fun project to work on during the break. I'll update this readme with a URL soon, so be sure to check back!
